# Home Assistant Repair Issues Guide

Home Assistant integrations use the **Repairs Framework** (*Settings → System → Repairs*) to present actionable issues directly on the user's dashboard rather than burying them in log files.

The MyHOME integration monitors gateway health, OpenWebNet frames, and hardware consistency. When an issue requires user attention, a Repair issue is raised. When conditions normalize, the integration **automatically resolves and withdraws** the issue.

## Unconfigured Timezone

**Repair Key**: `unconfigured_timezone`  
**Severity**: `WARNING`  
**Auto-Resolving**: Yes

### What it means
OpenWebNet gateways maintain an internal real-time clock (RTC) queried via WHO=13 dimension 0 (`*#13**0##`) or dimension 22 (`*#13**22##`). When a gateway has never had its timezone configured (or following a firmware factory reset), it emits a sentinel placeholder value `999` in the timezone field:
- Dimension 0: `*#13**0*<HH>*<MM>*<SS>*999##`
- Dimension 22: `*#13**22*<HH>*<MM>*<SS>*999*<DAY>*<MONTH>*<YEAR>##`

### Why it matters
1. **Clock & Timestamp Drift**: Without a configured timezone, scheduled scenario triggers and time broadcasts on the SCS bus may diverge from local daylight saving time or Home Assistant's clock.
2. **Diagnostic Reliability**: Underlying protocol parsers expect a standard UTC offset format (such as `+01:00` or numeric minute offsets).

### How to resolve
1. **Web Interface (F454, F455, MyHomeServer1)**:
   - Log into the gateway web admin interface (`http://<gateway_ip>`).
   - Navigate to **System Configuration** → **Date & Time** (or **Device Settings** → **Clock**).
   - Set the local timezone and enable NTP network time synchronization (e.g. `pool.ntp.org`).
   - Save and reboot.
2. **MyHOME_Suite / TiMyHome (MH200N, MH201, MH202, F452)**:
   - Connect to the gateway via USB or Ethernet.
   - Open **Gateway Settings** → **Date & Time**.
   - Configure local time, timezone, and automatic DST.
   - Send the configuration and reboot.

### How it clears
Once the gateway broadcasts an updated WHO=13 frame with a valid timezone offset, Home Assistant automatically removes this repair issue. You can also trigger an immediate check via **Developer Tools → Actions** using `myhome.sync_time`.

## Unknown Gateway Model

**Repair Key**: `unknown_gateway_model`  
**Severity**: `WARNING`  
**Auto-Resolving**: Yes

### What it means
The gateway reported a hardware device type code on WHO=13 dimension 15 (`*#13**15*<code>##`) that is unrecognized by both the official BTicino specification and known field data.

### How to resolve
Click **Learn More** on the repair issue. This will open a pre-filled GitHub issue template (`device_request.yml`). Attach an exported diagnostic trace (*Settings → Devices & Services → MyHOME → ⋮ → Download diagnostics*) so the community can identify the hardware and add native profiling support.

## Gateway Model Mismatch

**Repair Key**: `gateway_identity_mismatch`  
**Severity**: `WARNING`  
**Auto-Resolving**: Yes

### What it means
The hardware model reported by the gateway over the bus contradicts the model you selected in the configuration flow or discovered over SSDP, and the evidence is not conclusive enough for the integration to safely overwrite your setting.

### How to resolve
1. Check the physical hardware label on your gateway unit in the electrical cabinet.
2. Open **Settings → Devices & Services → MyHOME → ⋮ → Reconfigure**.
3. Select the correct physical model.

## Gateway Model Corrected

**Repair Key**: `gateway_identity_corrected`  
**Severity**: `WARNING`  
**Auto-Resolving**: Informational

### What it means
A manually selected model was contradicted by an authoritative, official 2006 BTicino device code (e.g. you selected `F454` but the gateway reported code `6`, which is an `F452`). The integration automatically updated your gateway profile and device registry to match the official hardware code.

### How to resolve
No action is required unless the correction was incorrect. If your physical hardware truly differs, verify the model label on the device.

## Gateway Authentication Failed

**Repair Key**: `gateway_authentication_failed`  
**Severity**: `ERROR`  
**Auto-Resolving**: Yes

### What it means
The gateway rejected the OpenWebNet password or HMAC SHA-negotiation credentials.

### How to resolve
1. Open **Settings → Devices & Services → MyHOME**.
2. Click **Reconfigure** on the gateway card.
3. Enter the correct OpenWebNet numeric password or HMAC secret.

## High SCS Bus Collision Rate

**Repair Key**: `bus_collision_storm`  
**Severity**: `WARNING`  
**Auto-Resolving**: Yes

### What it means
An unusually high rate of NACK frames or bus collisions was detected on the SCS physical bus.

### How to resolve
1. Verify physical bus wiring and ensure proper line termination (line end-resistors).
2. Ensure multiple command sessions or third-party gateways are not flooding the bus simultaneously.
3. Check the **Lovelace Bus Monitor Card** to identify which device address (`WHERE`) is generating frequent NACKs.
